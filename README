Offline Navigation System for Handheld Devices

The Android app is a prototype for an idea about indoor navigation - inside huge spaces like malls, buildings or campuses. The floor-map (and other relevant data) of the area is supplied. The user has to input his initial position at the start of the application. After that, the app keeps track of the user's movement using only inertial sensors - this is a pretty basic prototype, and the noise is extremely high, thereby restricting usability.
Added functionality is a feature to find a (shortest) path from point A to point B in the area (using Dijkstra's algorithm)
